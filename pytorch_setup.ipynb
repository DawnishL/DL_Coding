    "First, you may want to set up a new Python environment for each project (recommended!) in which you are going to install all the packages.\\\n",

    "\n",
    ">If you installed pip using your OS package manager you might have to call `pip3` instead of `pip`.\\\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, create a new environment with ```conda create -n <env_name> python=3.11``` (conda) or ```python -m virtualenv <path_to_env> --python python3.11``` (pip) - note that this needs Python 3.11 installed for pip or installs Python 3.11 in case of conda since this tutorial uses Python 3.11!\\\n",

    "\n",
    "Below we often call `pip` or `conda` using `%pip` and `%conda`, repectively, from a cell.\\\n",
    "These are magic commands for Jupyter Notebook, you can read more about them [here](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html).\\\n",
